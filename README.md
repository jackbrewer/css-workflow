# CSS Workflow

CSS used to be simple. Open a `.css` file, write some styles, save and FTP to the correct location. Job done.

These days we have a much more robust, testable, optimised workflow. I will attempt to summarise the way I approach this in a series of short blog posts, collected here until my personal blog is in a better place to host them.

These posts wont necessarily cover all aspects of the tools/ideas, but will be a more personal account of how I use them and the benefits they bring.
